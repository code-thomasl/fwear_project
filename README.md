# FWear Project

This is an Android application developped for Android 9.0 (SDK 29.0).
This is a simple application to send and receive messages throught a server.

This project is just like [wear_project](https://github.com/code-thomasl/wear_project) but "fake" as it's a normal Android application but with the same features as wear_project to work on normal Android emulator and not WearOS devices).
